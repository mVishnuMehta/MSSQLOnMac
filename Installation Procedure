Checking-
For ensuring whether the docker is installed or not in the terminal write Docker version.
After this write docker ps, docker container etc to ensure further checking
then write docker container ls to know about the container present in docker.
This command is used to move the file .bak format to the Azure data studio where it could be restored to extract the databases
present.
Command for the same to be used in the terminal 
-- sudo docker cp /Users/apple/Downloads/a.bak 1d7363dda97a:/var/opt/mssql/backup
